# Convexity Desk

> **Protect your crypto portfolio before the drawdown becomes obvious.**

Convexity Desk is a portfolio-protection and hedge-execution desk for crypto traders, SSI/index holders, and one-person on-chain fund managers. It reads a user's holdings, analyses market stress using SoSoValue intelligence and SoDEX market structure, then generates a clear, approval-gated hedge plan that can be previewed and later executed on SoDEX testnet.

## Current Build Phase

**Phase 12 — Methodology, Docs, and Settings Pages** *(complete)*

`/methodology` now explains the five-factor Danger Score, factor sources, risk bands, hedge sizing logic, execution-preview assumptions, safety controls, and data-mode transparency. `/docs` now documents the runtime architecture, internal API routes, demo pipeline, env groups, live/fallback/demo semantics, and Wave 2 limitations. `/about` now presents the product thesis, target users, design principles, build status, and Wave 3 roadmap. `/app/settings` is now an interactive client screen with `/api/status` integration, local app mode controls, risk profile selection, max hedge/slippage sliders, alert toggles, wallet/testnet placeholders, and Wave 3 persistence notes. Stale Phase 5/Phase 12 copy cleaned up. Production build passes.

**Phase 11 — Confirmation Gate and Outcome Ledger** *(complete)*

`ConfirmationGate` — 3 required checkboxes, hedge summary strip, danger score context, progressive unlock, disclaimer. `OutcomeLedgerTable` — sortable by date, status badge per row, coverage before→after, order ID, notes. `/api/hedge/confirm` creates `OutcomeLedgerEntry` (status: pending, simulated, SIM-xxx order ID). `/api/outcomes` returns pre-seeded demo entries (avoided_loss, useful, neutral) plus session entries. `/app/outcomes` — metric cards, status filter tabs, full ledger table, persistence notice. `/app/hedge` updated with gate → confirmed state → outcome link. 0 TS errors.

`src/lib/hedge/hedge-composer.ts` — instrument selection, danger score multiplier, hedge sizing (rounds to $1K), coverage % (hedge/hedgeable exposure), confidence score, rationale + risk builder, execution preview from SoDEX market data. `/api/hedge/generate` runs full pipeline (scan → compose → preview) in one POST. `/api/hedge/preview` refreshes preview only. `HedgePlanCard` (instrument, direction badge, size/coverage/confidence metric tiles, rationale, risks, stop condition). `ExecutionPreviewCard` (data rows, liquidity bar, categorised warnings). Full interactive `/app/hedge`: idle → generating → results (scan strip + gauge + plan + preview + confirm CTA) → error. 0 TS errors.

`src/lib/risk/convexity-score.ts` — deterministic 5-factor Danger Score (instFlow×0.30 + narrative×0.20 + concentration×0.25 + microstructure×0.15 + eventProximity×0.10). Each factor has its own calculator, explanation generator, and evidence linker. `/api/scan/run` runs all adapters in parallel and returns `{ scan, evidenceCards, dataMode }`. `DangerScoreGauge` (animated SVG arc, 270° sweep), `RiskFactorCard` (score bar + explanation + contribution pts). Full interactive `/app/scan`: idle → scanning (animated steps) → results (gauge + 5 factor cards + evidence grid + hedge CTA) → error state. 0 TS errors.

`src/lib/adapters/sosovalue.ts` — server-side adapter remains ready for `SOSOVALUE_API_KEY`, but SoSoValue is currently **fallback** because no API key has been issued yet. API access has been requested. Until the key is added, `/api/status` reports "SoSoValue: Fallback — API key not configured" and the app uses typed fallback evidence cards. `EvidenceCardList` labels the source clearly. 0 TS errors.

`src/lib/adapters/sodex.ts` — attempts unsigned public/testnet reads from documented SoDEX endpoints (`testnet-gw.sodex.dev/api/v1` and configured env roots) for perps/spot tickers and book tickers, normalises market data, and falls back to typed BTC/ETH/SOL market data if the public gateway fails. `/api/market/sodex`, hedge previews, and microstructure stress use this adapter. Execution remains preview/simulation only; no live trade placement is implemented.

Demo portfolio data in `src/lib/data/demo-portfolio.ts`. `/api/portfolio/demo` returns live data. `/app/portfolio` shows concentration warning, 4 metric cards, Recharts donut allocation chart with custom legend, exposure buckets panel (5 buckets with progress bars), and full asset table (amount, price, value, weight bar, risk contribution, beta bucket badge, hedgeable icon). 0 TS errors.

## Product Thesis

Most crypto tools tell users what to buy next. Convexity Desk focuses on what users **already hold**.

The core question is:

> "Given my current portfolio, what downside risk is building, what evidence supports that risk, and what is the cleanest hedge I can take before the market moves against me?"

The core product flow is:

**Portfolio → Risk Scan → Evidence → Hedge Plan → Execution Preview → Confirmation → Outcome Tracking**

---

## Target Users

1. **Crypto spot traders** — holding BTC, ETH, SOL, SOSO, or other assets who want to know when to reduce risk or hedge
2. **SSI/index holders** — holding thematic crypto baskets who need protection when a full sector weakens
3. **One-person fund managers** — solo traders managing portfolios who need a professional risk layer
4. **Signal group admins** — people checking whether an existing exposure is dangerous before recommending action

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for full list. Key variables:

```env
# SoSoValue Integration
SOSOVALUE_API_KEY=
SOSOVALUE_BASE_URL=https://openapi.sosovalue.com

# SoDEX Integration
SODEX_BASE_URL=
SODEX_TESTNET_BASE_URL=
SODEX_API_KEY=

# App Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MODE=demo
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

---

## Data Mode Status

| Integration | Current Mode | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| SoSoValue | `fallback` | API access requested; waiting for `SOSOVALUE_API_KEY` |
| SoDEX Market | `live` or `fallback` | Adapter attempts unsigned public/testnet market reads, then typed fallback |
| Portfolio Data | `demo` | Static Wave 2 demo portfolio |
| Overall Mode | `demo` or `mixed` | `/api/status` reports live/fallback status |

All live/fallback/mock status will be clearly labelled in the UI once implemented. The app will never claim mock data is live.

---

## Known Issues

- None — all 22 routes build cleanly

## How to Run Locally

*(Available after Phase 1)*

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

---

## Deployment Notes

- Target: Vercel
- Environment variables must be configured in Vercel dashboard
- Demo mode works without any API keys configured
- SoSoValue live mode requires `SOSOVALUE_API_KEY`; API access has been requested but the key is not available yet
- SoDEX public/testnet market reads are attempted without trade execution; order placement remains disabled until signing is safe
